**INTRODUCTION**:

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
They are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases.
Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention.
The World Health Organization (WHO) is working closely with global experts, governments and partners to rapidly expand scientific knowledge on this new virus, to track the spread and virulence of the virus, and to provide advice to countries and individuals on measures to protect health and prevent the spread of this outbreak.

**HOW IT SPREADS**:

The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.
You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are near someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth. The virus spreads more easily indoors and in crowded settings.

COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalization.
Most common symptoms:
fever
cough
tiredness
loss of taste or smell
Less common symptoms:
sore throat
headache
aches and pains
diarrhoea
a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes
red or irritated eyes

People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms at home.
On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days.
Hence, it is now clear that coronavirus is a global concerned taht should be analyzed. Hence, this project contains a case study, analysis and visualization of covid-19 cases across some part of the countries in the world 

**Aim**:

My aim of doing this project is to get valuable meaning and insight of how the covid-19 rate has incraesed or reduced cross teh countries.
also to know the trend of death/recovered/active cases and to compare all togther

**Source of data**:

the dataset i used was gotten from kaggle which includes (187 rows x 15 columns) and the columns were made of:
Country/Region	
Confirmed	Deaths	
Recovered	Active	
New cases
New deaths	
New recovered	
Deaths / 100 Cases	
Recovered / 100 Cases	
Deaths / 100 Recovered	
Confirmed last week
1 week change	
1 week % increase
WHO Region

The analysis was done using python programming language, on jupiter notebook for both analysis and visualization

**Packages used**:

**PANDAS:**I used pandas to impoert my dataset and handlee teh messy data, NUMPY: was used to work on array and for mathematical opeartions, SEABORN and MATPLOTLIB was used for the visualization

**Data Cleaning**:

After downloading teh data from kaggle, i needed to clean the data in order to perform an Exploratory data analysis. First i checked for missing data and i also renamed soem columns, i also needed to remove some columns which i dont need. 

**Conclusion**
After analysing the data i finally came to a conclusion that:
United state had the highest number of death cases followed by brazil, mexico and united kingdom...
Countries such as brazil, US, indian has the highest rate of new cases while the countries that ahs teh highest number of active cases are US, brazil, indian, united kingdom,Russia southAfrica, columbia,france,canada...
